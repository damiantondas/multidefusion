# Installation

## Stable release

To install the MultiDEFusion library, execute the following command in a terminal:

```
pip install multidefusion
```

If you do not have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, you can find instructions to install pip [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/).

## Python Requirements

This library is compatible with Python 3.8 and later versions.

## Integrated Development Environments

The library works in the Python environment. To run the integration procedure, the usage of one of the Python Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is required. The current version of the library has been tested on four different IDEs: [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Before starting the fusion process, ensure that your IDE is configured correctly.

### Remarks

1. Within a particular IDE, ensure that the path of your Python interpreter is the same as that used in the terminal during installation. The example of changing the Python environment path in the Spyder can be found [here](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/faq.html#using-existing-environment).
2. Using PyCharm, launch the script using *Run File In Python Console*. This setting can be defined as constant in *Run* &#8594; *Edit Configurations* &#8594; *Run with Python console*. The example can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16874046/running-a-module-from-the-pycharm-console).
3. Using Visual Studio Code, launch the script using *Run in Interactive Window*. To make this option available, the installation of the [Jupyter extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py) may be required. The example can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75237574/get-the-python-console-in-a-vscode).
